# hashtags

Starter code for reading in a bunch of tweets and finding the most frequent hashtags.

Each group should make a local copy of the repo (so, 4 copies per team). Then:
- write your function
- add and commit your code
- git pull  # this is important for merging together your team's code!
- git push origin master

once all 4 groups have finished their functions, all code should be in one place -- try it out!
